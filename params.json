We're keeping a running list of authoring app BCn load status on the Wiki [here](https://github.com/GameTechDev/Intel-Texture-Works-Plugin/wiki/BCn-App-Support)\r\n* To implement BCn texture compression in your own apps and engines [download the sample source code here](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/fast-ispc-texture-compressor-update)\r\n* The [FAQ](https://github.com/GameTechDev/Intel-Texture-Works-Plugin/wiki/FAQ) is also available on the Wiki\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\n* Windows\\* (32/64) versions 7, 8, 10\r\n* Photoshop\\* CS6 through CC2015\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\n\r\n# Source Code\r\n## Prerequisites ##\r\n\r\n- Visual Studio 2012 (or possibly higher, although so far all builds created with 2012)\r\n- Photoshop CS6 SDK, can be obtained from here: http://www.adobe.com/devnet/photoshop/sdk.html\r\n- Adobe Photoshop 32 or 64 bit, CS6 or higher.\r\n\r\n## First time set-up ##\r\n\r\n- Install Photoshop CS6 SDK on developer machine\r\n- Open IntelTextureTools solution \r\n- Go to Property Manager and edit settings for Microsoft.Cpp.Win32.user and Microsoft.Cpp.x64.user, adding the following User Macro\r\n\tPHOTOSHOP_SDK_CS6 = <full path to location of Photoshop CS6 SDK> \r\n- Choose platform appropriate to the version of Photoshop you wish to test with (Win32 or x64)\r\n- Build! For convenience plugin binaries will be copied to \"~/Plugins/[platform]\" folder.\r\n\r\n## To easily run/debug from Visual Studio ##\r\n\r\n- create an alias/shortcut to the appropriate platform folder and place it in the matching Photoshop Plug-ins folder (this will allow photoshop to load plugin from build location) \r\n- in plugin project, select Properties->Configuration->Debugging->Target and browse to photoshop executable\r\n\r\n## 3rd Party code ## \r\n\r\nThis project utilizes the following code (located under 3rdParty folder)\r\n- DirectXTex, from https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXTex (Sourced from tag Jul2015)\r\n- Intel, BC compression code and helpers \r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n* Other names and brands may be claimed by their owners.\r\n```","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
